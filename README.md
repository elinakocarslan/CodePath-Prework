## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
-Instagram
  -Loading feature
  -Archived Posts
-Pinterest
  -Saving pins to boards
  -The search page
-Spotify
  -Song recommendations
  -Videos instead of album cover

Creating an app that would keep streaks or award points/coins of tasks achieved by the user would be a realy cool productivity app. There could be a leaderboard with the streaks that are compared with friends, and there could also be points awarded that the user could use in the app (for example customizing avatar).

## Notes

XCode very laggy.
